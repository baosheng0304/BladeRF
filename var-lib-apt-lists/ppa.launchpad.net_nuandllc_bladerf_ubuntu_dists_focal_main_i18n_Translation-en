Description-en: Nuand bladeRF firmware downloader (FX3)
 This package will, at the time of installation, download an appropriate
 firmware image for using the Nuand bladeRF with a Cypress FX3 USB
 controller.  The image will be downloaded from https://nuand.com/fx3/
 and saved to /usr/share/Nuand/bladeRF.
